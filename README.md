## üíª Usage

HWID Spoofer provides a simple text-based menu interface for interacting with the spoofing options.

Upon running the program, you'll see:

```
=== HWID Spoofer ===

  Select an option:
  [1] Spoof Installation ID
  [2] Spoof PC Name
  [3] Spoof MAC Address
  [4] Spoof GUID
  [5] Spoof Hostname
  [6] Spoof Machine GUID
  [7] Clean Traces
  [exit] Exit
```

Simply choose the number of the action you'd like to perform.
